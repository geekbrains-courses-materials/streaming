    "info": "The Hyundai i40 is a large family car designed primarily for the European market by the South Korean manufacturer Hyundai. Sharing its platform with the United States-marketed Hyundai Sonata,[4] the i40 sedan was unveiled at the 2011 Barcelona Motor Show.[5]\r\n\r\nIn some markets, the Sonata remains on sale as a separate model, such as the United States, where the i40 is unavailable. The estate/wagon variant of the i40 was released in Europe and South Korea in September 2011, followed by the sedan variant in January 2012,[6] and it is also sold in Australia and New Zealand.\r\n\r\nFor Malaysia, Hyundai launched the i40 at the 2013 Kuala Lumpur International Motor Show, in both sedan and tourer specifications. It is placed above the Hyundai Sonata. The engine is the two litre GDI motor which is linked to a paddle shifted six speed automatic gearbox.[7]\r\n\r\nDue to slowing sales of mid-sized cars worldwide, the i40 was discontinued in markets such as Australia and New Zealand in early 2019, leaving the Sonata to cater for the segment. The i40 has since been discontinued in Europe as of 2020."
