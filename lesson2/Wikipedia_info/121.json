    "info": "The Toyota Auris (Japanese: \u30c8\u30e8\u30bf\u30fb\u30aa\u30fc\u30ea\u30b9, Hepburn: Toyota \u014crisu) is a compact car derived from the Corolla, manufactured and sold by Toyota. Introduced in 2006, the first generation three/five-door hatchback shared the platform with the E150 series Corolla, while the second generation five-door hatchback and station wagon called \"Touring Sports\" uses the E180 platform. The \"Auris\" name is based on the Latin word for \"gold\", \"aurum\".\r\n\r\nIn Europe, Toyota positioned the Auris as the replacement for the Corolla hatchback, while the saloon version continued with the Corolla nameplate. Starting with the E210 model, the Auris nameplate was discontinued and used the Corolla nameplate instead, except for Taiwan, retained the Auris nameplate for the hatchback version until July 2020.\r\n\r\nFor the first generation only, the more luxurious Auris was named Toyota Blade (Japanese: \u30c8\u30e8\u30bf\u30fb\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30c9, Hepburn: Toyota Bureido) in Japan. The Auris succeeded the Allex in Japan and the Corolla RunX. Toyota Australia and Toyota New Zealand resisted suggestions from Toyota Japan to adopt the new European Auris name for the Corolla.[1]\r\n\r\nThe Japanese model went on sale at Netz dealerships on 23 October 2006, while European models went on sale in early 2007.[2] The second generation was later available at Toyopet Store dealerships from 18 April 2016."
