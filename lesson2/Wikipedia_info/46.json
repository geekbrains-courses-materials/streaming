    "info": "The BMW i8 was a plug-in hybrid sports car developed by BMW. The i8 was part of BMW's electrified fleet and was marketed under the BMW i sub-brand. The production version of the BMW i8 was unveiled at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show and was released in Germany in June 2014.[12] Deliveries to retail customers in the U.S. began in August 2014.[13] A roadster variant was launched in May 2018.[14] Production ended in June 2020.[15]\r\n\r\nThe 2015 BMW i8 accelerated from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.4 seconds[16][17] and had an electronically limited top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph).[5] The 2015 model year i8 had a 7.1-kWh lithium-ion battery pack that delivered an all-electric range of 37 km (23 mi) under the New European Driving Cycle. Under the U.S. EPA cycle, the range in EV mode was 24 km (15 mi).[8] The battery capacity of both the BMW i8 Roadster and the i8 Coupe was increased to 11.6 kWh in 2018, allowing the NEDC electric range to rise to 55 km (34 mi) for the coup\u00e9 and 53 km (33 mi) for the roadster.[6]\r\n\r\nThe BMW i8 coup\u00e9 had a fuel efficiency of 2.1 L/100 km (134.5 mpg\u2011imp; 112.0 mpg\u2011US) under the NEDC test with carbon emissions of 49 g/km. The EPA rated the i8 combined fuel economy at 76 MPGe (3.1 L gasoline-equivalent/100 km; 91 mpg-imp gasoline-equivalent) and 29 miles per gallon (6.7L/100 km) when running in pure gasoline mode.[8]\r\n\r\nBy March 2020, global sales of all variants had reached more than 20,000 units, making the BMW i8 the world's top-selling plug-in electric sports car, and exceeding sales of all competitors in its segment combined.[6]"
