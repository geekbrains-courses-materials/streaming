    "info": "The Hyundai Veloster (Korean: \ud604\ub300 \ubca8\ub85c\uc2a4\ud130, romanized: Hyeondae Belloseuteo) is a hatchback coup\u00e9 first produced in 2011 by Hyundai, with sales beginning in South Korea on March 10, 2011, and in Canada and the United States[N 1] since the fall of 2011. In South Korea, it is marketed under Hyundai's 'Premium Youth Lab'. It was unveiled on January 10, 2011, at the Detroit Auto Show, and fills the void left when Hyundai discontinued the Hyundai Tiburon after the 2008 model year.\r\n\r\nThe car differs from many competitors with its asymmetrical door configuration, featuring one large door on the driver side and two smaller doors on the passenger side. This configuration is more common on commercial vehicles and minivans. In North America, the Veloster is equipped with Blue Link, a new telematics system which will eventually be standard on all Hyundai models. The system is comparable to OnStar in GM vehicles, and provides customers with automatic crash notification, vehicle diagnostics, and remote control of vehicle features, among others."
