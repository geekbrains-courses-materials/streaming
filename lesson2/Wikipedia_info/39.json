    "info": "The BMW M4 is a high-performance version of the BMW 4 Series coupes and convertibles developed by BMW's motorsport division, BMW M, and marketed since 2014.\r\n\r\nAs part of the renumbering that splits the 3 Series coup\u00e9 and convertible models into the 4 Series (to further differentiate these from the 3 Series), the M4 replaced the BMW M3 coup\u00e9 and convertible models. Upgrades over the standard BMW 4 Series include an upgraded engine, suspension, exhaust system, brakes and weight reduction measures including increased use of carbon fibre, such as on the roof of the car."
