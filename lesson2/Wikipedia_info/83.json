    "info": "The Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, formerly Mercedes-Benz M-Class, is a mid-size luxury SUV produced by the German automaker Mercedes-Benz since 1997. In terms of size, it is slotted in between the smaller GLC-Class (based on the C-Class) and the larger GLS-Class, the latter with which it shares platforms.\r\n\r\nFor a short time, between 1999 and 2002, the M-Class was also built by Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria, for the European market, before all production moved to the U.S. plant near Vance, Alabama. From late 2012, the M-Class was also assembled at new plants in India, Indonesia and Thailand.\r\n\r\nSince April 2015, the M-Class has been renamed to the Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class in an effort to harmonize the various nameplates, aligning it with the E-Class."
