    "info": "Ford Ranger is a nameplate that has been used on multiple model lines of pickup trucks sold by Ford worldwide. The nameplate has been used for distinct model lines of vehicles worldwide since 1982 from the compact and mid-size pickup category.\r\n\r\nThe Ford Ranger debuted as a compact pickup mainly sold in North America since 1982 for the 1983 model year, with later introductions in some South American countries. Between 1998 and 2011, the Ranger nameplate is also used for models that was developed by Mazda for sale outside the North American market. In 2011, Ford introduced the first Ranger based on the T6 platform. Considered a mid-size pickup truck, the model was developed in-house by Ford Australia. In the same year, the North American-market Ranger was discontinued, leaving the T6 platform-based Ranger as the sole Ranger model worldwide.\r\n\r\nFor the 2019 model year, the Ranger is reintroduced in North America using the globally-marketed T6 model. It is produced at the Michigan Assembly Plant at Wayne, Michigan. The Ranger currently slotted below the F-150 and above the Maverick in the Ford North American pickup truck range, while for markets outside the Americas it is typically the only Ford pickup offered for sale.\r\n\r\nThe second generation of the T6-based Ranger was released in 2021 for worldwide markets, using the same T6 platform with revisions."
