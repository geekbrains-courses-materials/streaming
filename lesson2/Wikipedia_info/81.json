    "info": "The Mercedes-Benz CLA class is a series of luxury compact executive cars manufactured by Mercedes-Benz since 2013. The first generation was a four-door sedan based on the platform of the W176 A-Class and W246 B-Class compact cars, marketed as a four-door coup\u00e9.[1] In 2015, Mercedes-Benz expanded the CLA family to include the Shooting Brake, a station wagon configuration.[2] As the V177 A-Class sedan took its place as the budget-conscious sedan, the second generation got longer and wider than the W205 C-Class.[3]\r\n\r\nThe CLA is Mercedes-Benz's first front-wheel drive vehicle offered in the North American market. The CLA range is positioned above the A-Class and it is nearly on the level of the C-Class in the Mercedes model range, and models tend to be less practical than the A-Class it is based on.[4]\r\n\r\nThe CLA first went on sale in Europe in April 2013, and was subsequently introduced in the United States in September 2013.[5] Its largest markets are Western Europe and the United States.[5] Global cumulative CLA sales reached 100,000 during its first year,[5] cited as \"our best launch in 20 years\" by Mercedes-Benz.[6] Worldwide, Mercedes-Benz sold about 750,000 units of the first generation."
