    "info": "The second generation Ractis was unveiled at the 2010 Paris Motor Show as the Toyota Verso-S (Japanese: \u30c8\u30e8\u30bf\u30fb\u30f4\u30a1\u30fc\u30bd\u30fbS, Toyota Vu\u0101so S).[8][9] The Ractis is produced at the Iwate plant by Kanto Auto Works. It is available in 1.3 L and 1.5 L engines with G, X and S grades in Japan. The introduction of the Verso S marked the re entry of Toyota into the European B MPV segment.\r\n\r\nWhen it hit the market, the Verso S had the shortest overall length of any mini MPV in Europe.[10] The Verso S is available with a choice of two engines, a 1.3 litre petrol unit or a 1.4 litre D 4D turbodiesel unit, both mated to a six speed manual transmission.\r\n\r\nThe petrol derivative is also offered with an optional, Multidrive S CVT, which features a seven speed, sequential paddle shift mode. The petrol model delivers a combined fuel economy of 18.2 km/L (51 mpg\u2011imp; 43 mpg\u2011US) and CO2 emissions of 127 g/km. The diesel model delivers 23.25 km/L (66 mpg\u2011imp; 55 mpg\u2011US) and 113 g/km respectively.[11]\r\n\r\nToyota UK discontinued the Verso S in 2013.[citation needed] On June 30, 2016, Toyota confirmed that the Ractis reached the end of production for Japanese, Hong Kong and Macau markets, but the Verso S continued to be produced for European markets until 2017.[citation needed] Sales of the Ractis in Japan ended on August 31, 2016.[citation needed] It was succeeded by the Toyota Tank/Roomy.\r\n\r\nThe five seater variant of the facelifted XP170 Sienta, the Funbase, which was released on September 11, 2018, is also considered as the successor of the Ractis."
