    "info": "Developed by Ford Brazil,[34] the Ford Ka Concept was unveiled in Brazil in November 2013.[35] The production version of this new Ford Ka appeared in July 2014,[36] in hatchback and sedan body styles, with the first units arriving in Brazil in September and October 2014 respectively.[37] The next market where it was launched was India,[34] where the sedan made its debut as the new Ford Figo Aspire in August 2015,[38] with the hatchback arriving (as the new Ford Figo) a month later.[39] It was launched in Europe (as the Ka+) in June 2016, with deliveries starting later that year.[40] The '+' in the name shows the fact how Ford sees this as a budget B-segment car, rather than an A-segment car.\r\n\r\nThe new model was based on Ford's global B platform, sharing its underpinnings with the Fiesta supermini,[34] and embodies Ford's Kinetic 2.0 design theme.[41] The hatchback is a five-door only model and it is now 266 mm (10.5 in) longer than the previous model, with the wheelbase increased by 190 mm (7.5 in).[42] The four-door sedan has the same wheelbase as the hatchback, but two length variants: a longer one in Brazil (dubbed Ka+), measuring 4,254 mm (167.5 in),[43] and a shorter one exclusively in India (dubbed Aspire), measuring 3,995 mm (157.3 in).[44]\r\n\r\nIn Brazil, it was offered with a choice of two petrol engines -[34] a 1.0-litre three-cylinder, developing 59 kW (80 PS) and 100 N\u22c5m (74 lb\u22c5ft) or a 1.5-litre four-cylinder, developing 77 kW (105 PS) and 143 N\u22c5m (105 lb\u22c5ft).[42] In India,[34] the range consists of either a 1.2-litre four-cylinder petrol, developing 65 kW (88 PS) and 112 N\u22c5m (83 lb\u22c5ft), a 1.5-litre four-cylinder diesel, developing 74 kW (100 PS) and 215 N\u22c5m (159 lb\u22c5ft), or a 1.5-litre four-cylinder petrol,[45] developing 82 kW (112 PS) and 136 N\u22c5m (100 lb\u22c5ft).[46] The latter is paired with Ford's six-speed automatic PowerShift transmission,[46] while for the rest a five-speed manual option is available. In Europe, the Ka+ came with only one engine, a 1.2-litre unit, that came with either 51 kW (70 PS), in the Studio or the Zetec trim levels, or 63 kW (85 PS), exclusively in the Zetec model.[33]\r\n\r\nIt features equipment such as the Ford's MyKey, MyDock, and SYNC systems, steering-mounted controls, automatic climate control, power-fold mirrors, keyless entry, electronic stability control, cruise control (in Europe),[47] up to six airbags and high-strength steel body structure.[46]\r\n\r\nIn November 2015, a Ka+ model with two standard front airbags and standard anti-ock braking system with [[electronic brakeforce distribution was tested by Latin NCAP and was awarded four stars out of five. In a frontal impact,the driver's head and chest were considered to receive adequate protection, the passenger's head and chest received good protection, while the driver's and passenger's knee areas received marginal protection. The bodyshell was rated as stable and was capable of withstanding further loading.[48]\r\n\r\nIn March 2017, Euro NCAP released the results of the tests performed on the Ka+ and it scored three out of five stars.[49] For the adult occupants, it received a 73% rating, for the child occupant, a 61% rating, for the pedestrian, a 57% rating, and the safety assist category, a 29% rating.[50] The car's performance in the tests was rated as \"mediocre\", being criticized for lacking rear seatbelt pretensioners and load limiters, poor chest protection in the full-width frontal crash test, and the lack of autonomous braking technology.[49]"
