    "info": "The BMW M2 is a high-performance version of the BMW 2 Series automobile developed by BMW's motorsport division, BMW M GmbH.\r\n\r\nAs the 2 Series replaced the 1 Series coup\u00e9 and convertible models, the first generation M2 was marketed as the most basic M Car in the range. The M2 featured a more powerful and responsive, turbocharged and special tuned BMW N55 engine, while its successors, the M2 Competition and M2 CS, featured a high performance twin-turbocharged engine developed by BMW M GmbH (S55 engine); improved handling, suspension, and braking systems; aerodynamic body enhancements; interior/exterior accents with the tri-colour \"M\" (Motorsport) badging and increased weight. The M2 is unofficially considered as an indirect successor to the BMW 1 Series M Coup\u00e9."
