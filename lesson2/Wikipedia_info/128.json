    "info": "The Citro\u00ebn Jumpy (badged Citro\u00ebn Dispatch in some countries) is a light commercial van originally developed by the Sevel subdivision of Stellantis under the Fiat, Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn brands, produced since 1994. The Jumpy was also sold as the Peugeot Expert and Fiat Scudo beginning in 1995.\r\n\r\nAll three models were facelifted in March 2004, before being replaced by new second generation models in January 2007. The redesigned models again shared the same design and engineering, with subtle trim changes between each brand. The second generation received a small facelift in February 2012, and from July 2013, Toyota began sales of a rebadged version called Toyota ProAce.\r\n\r\nOn 1 December 2015, Citro\u00ebn, Peugeot and Toyota unveiled their new generation of these vehicles, in people carrying specifications called Citro\u00ebn SpaceTourer and Peugeot Traveller,[1] with Toyota retaining the ProAce name. The commercial versions premiered later, retaining the Peugeot Expert and Citro\u00ebn Jumpy names.\r\n\r\nIn July 2016, the Fiat Scudo was replaced by a second generation of the Fiat Talento, which is a rebadged Renault Trafic.[2] From the model year of 2019, the Jumpy is also rebadged as the Opel/Vauxhall Vivaro, replacing the previous model Vivaro, which from 1997 until 2018 had been based on the Renault Trafic. From the model year of 2022, the Jumpy is also rebadged as the Fiat Scudo.[3]"
