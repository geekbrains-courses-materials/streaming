    "info": "The Audi A6 is an executive car made by the German automaker Audi. Now in its fifth generation, the successor to the Audi 100 is manufactured in Neckarsulm, Germany, and is available in saloon and estate configurations, the latter marketed by Audi as the Avant. Audi's internal numbering treats the A6 as a continuation of the Audi 100 lineage, with the initial A6 designated as a member of the C4-series, followed by the C5, C6, C7, and the C8. The related Audi A7 is essentially a Sportback (liftback) version of the C7-series[1] and C8-series A6 but is marketed under its own separate identity and model designation.\r\n\r\nAll generations of the A6 have offered either front-wheel-drive or Torsen-based four-wheel-drive, marketed by Audi as their quattro system. The A6 has also been used as the basis for the company's Allroad models since 1999.\r\n\r\nBoth petrol and diesel versions of the A6 are offered. The wide range of engines available have power outputs ranging from 150 to 333 PS (110 to 245 kW). These are inline four-cylinder turbocharged engines and more powerful 3-litre units in a V6 configuration with a mechanical compressor."
