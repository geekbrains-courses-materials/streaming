    "info": "The BMW M3 is a high-performance version of the BMW 3 Series, developed by BMW's in-house motorsport division, BMW M GmbH. M3 models have been produced for every generation of 3 Series since the E30 M3 was introduced in 1986.\r\n\r\nThe initial model was available in a coup\u00e9 body style, with a convertible body style added soon after. M3 Sedans were available during the E36 (1994\u20131999) and E90 (2008\u20132012) generations. Since 2014, the M3 has been solely produced in the sedan body style, due to the coup\u00e9 and convertible models being rebranded as the 4 Series range, making the high-performance variant the M4.[1][2]\r\n\r\nUpgrades over the regular 3 Series models include engines, handling, brakes, aerodynamics, lightweight materials and various interior upgrades. The M3\u2019s biggest contribution to both driver safety and the performance industry is BMW\u2019s continual development of their limited-slip differential, which mathematically maximizes torque and grip without compromising handling. The M3\u2019s most notable implementation of technology came in 1992 when the E36 M3 was outfitted with the SMG-I gearbox and became the first car sold in the united states to have a sequential manual transmission. When they fitted the E46 M3 with the SMG-III gearbox, it officially took the title as the fastest shifting gear box in the world. A carbon fiber air box was developed for the E46 M3 CSL, and it worked by creating a vortex of air that could constantly maintain maximum air induction pressure to maximize throttle response."
