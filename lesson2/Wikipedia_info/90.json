    "info": "The Mercedes-Benz R-Class is a large MPV introduced by Mercedes-Benz in 2005 for the 2006 model year. Following the success of the smaller A- and B-Class MPVs, Mercedes presented a concept vehicle, Vision GST (Grand Sports Tourer), at the 2002 Detroit Auto Show, subsequently introducing the production version at 2005 New York International Auto Show. The R-Class was manufactured in Vance, Alabama until 2015 when its production was shifted to Mishawaka, Indiana for a smaller volume production until 2017.\r\n\r\nThe R-Class shared its platform with the M-Class (W164) and GL-Class (X164) and was available in two wheelbase lengths: standard 2,980 mm (117.3 in) and long 3,215 mm (126.6 in). The R-Class was sold in the United States and Canada in long wheelbase only. The R-Class in both standard and long wheelbases were sold internationally until the end of 2013 with exception of China where R 320 and R 400 with long wheelbase continued to be sold until 2017."
