    "info": "The BMW X1 is a line of subcompact luxury crossovers produced by BMW. Debuted in 2009, the first-generation X1 has been based on the E90 3 Series and offers rear-wheel drive layout as standard. At its introduction, it was positioned as the smallest SUV in BMW line-up below the X3, aiming a wider range of customers due to its smaller size, increased efficiency, and a lower price tag due to the all-wheel drive layout (xDrive) being optional.\r\n\r\nThe second-generation X1 marked the switch to the front-wheel drive-based layout by using the UKL2 platform shared with the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer and the Mini Countryman.[1] Despite its name, it is currently only the second smallest SUV produced by BMW since the introduction of the X2"
