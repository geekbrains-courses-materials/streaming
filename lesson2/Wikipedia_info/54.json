Known by the project name LM, it took 36 months and 280 billion won (approx. US$225 million) to develop.[26][27]\r\n\r\nThe ix35's styling was reported to be based on Hyundai ix-onic concept.[28] The ix35 was penned by Hyundai designer Cha Il-Hoei in 2007, under the guidance of former BMW designer Thomas B\u00fcrkle at Hyundai's R\u00fcsselsheim design studio in Germany and continues the company's styling language, marketed as \"fluidic sculpture\".[29][30] The compact crossover vehicle has sweeping coupe-like lines, a premium vehicle feel and comes with features unavailable on its predecessor."
