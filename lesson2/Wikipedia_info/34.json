    "info": "The BMW 3 Series is a line of compact executive cars manufactured by the German automaker BMW since May 1975. It is the successor to the 02 Series and has been produced in seven different generations.\r\n\r\nThe first generation of the 3 Series was only available as a 2-door coup\u00e9; however, the model range has since expanded to include a 4-door saloon, 2-door convertible, 2-door coup\u00e9, 5-door estate, 5-door liftback (\"Gran Turismo\") and 3-door hatchback body styles. Since 2013, the coup\u00e9 and convertible models have been marketed as the 4 Series; therefore, the 3 Series range no longer includes these body styles.\r\n\r\nThe 3 Series is BMW's best-selling model, accounting for around 30% of the BMW brand's annual total sales (excluding motorbikes),[1] and has won numerous awards throughout its history.\r\n\r\nThe M version of the 3 series, M3, debuted with the E30 M3 in 1986."
