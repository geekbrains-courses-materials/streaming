    "info": "The Hyundai Accent (Korean: \ud604\ub300 \uc5d1\uc13c\ud2b8), or Hyundai Verna (\ud604\ub300 \ubca0\ub974\ub098) is a subcompact car produced by Hyundai. In Australia, the first generation models carried over the Hyundai Excel name used by the Accent's predecessor. The Accent was replaced in 2000 by the Hyundai Verna in South Korea, although most international markets, including the US, retained the \"Accent\" name. The \"Accent\" name is an abbreviation of Advanced Compact Car of Epoch-making New Technology.[1]\r\n\r\nThe Accent is produced for the Chinese market by Beijing Hyundai Co., a joint venture with Beijing Automotive Industry Corp. For the Russian market it was assembled by the TagAZ plant in Taganrog until 2011, and since 2011 it is assembled by the HMMR plant in Saint Petersburg and sold under the new name Hyundai Solaris. In Mexico, the Accent was marketed until 2014 by Chrysler as the Dodge Attitude, previously known as the Verna by Dodge. In Venezuela, Chrysler marketed these models as the Dodge Brisa until 2006. The Brisa was assembled by Mitsubishi Motors at its plant in Barcelona, Venezuela. Since 2002, the Accent had been the longest-running small family car sold in North America. In Puerto Rico, it was sold as the Hyundai Brio.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Hyundai Accent was named the most dependable subcompact car by J.D. Power and Associates.[2]"
