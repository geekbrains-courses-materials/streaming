    "info": "The Toyota iQ is an ultra-compact, front transverse engine, front-wheel-drive city car manufactured by Toyota and marketed in a single generation for Japan (2008\u20132016); Europe (2008\u20132015); and North America (2012\u20132015), where it was marketed as the Scion iQ.[2] A rebadged variant was marketed in Europe as the Aston Martin Cygnet (2009\u20132013).\r\n\r\nDesigned at the Toyota European Design and Development studio in Nice, France, the iQ is noted for its specialized engineering to maximize passenger space and minimize length. The design accommodates four occupants, although one of the seats has very little legroom and is not suitable for adults.\r\n\r\nFollowing a concept presented at the 2007 Frankfurt Auto Show,[3] the production iQ debuted at the March 2008 Geneva Motor Show. Japanese sales began in November 2008 and European sales in January 2009.[4] In 2008, the iQ was named the Japanese Car of the Year.\r\n\r\nThe name iQ, an initialism of the term intelligence quotient, recalls a competitor, the Smart Fortwo. The letters \"iQ\" also stand for \"individuality\", \"innovation\", \"quality\", a hint at its \"cubic form\" and also a \"cue\" for owners to embrace new types of vehicles and lifestyles.\r\n\r\nThe iQ reached the end of production in December 2015, and it was discontinued in Japan in April 2016."
