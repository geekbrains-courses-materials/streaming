    "info": "The first-generation BMW Z4 was known as the E85 in roadster form and E86 in coup\u00e9 form.[13] It was designed by Danish BMW-designer Anders Warming.[14]\r\n\r\nThe Z4's design addressed many criticisms of the preceding Z3; it was larger and featured a significantly stiffer chassis.[15] The Z4 was initially only available as a roadster, but a coup\u00e9 version was officially launched in 2006.[16] The last model rolled off the assembly line on 27 August 2008 at the Spartanburg plant."
