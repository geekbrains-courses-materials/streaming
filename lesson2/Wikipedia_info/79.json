    "info": "The Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class is a series of executive cars produced by Mercedes-Benz since 2004.\r\n\r\nThe original model was a four-door fastback sedan based on the Mercedes E-Class platform, marketed as a four door coup\u00e9.[1] An estate (Shooting Brake) model was later added to the model range with the second generation CLS.[2] All models are available as a high performance AMG variant, although it wasn't until the second generation CLS that 4MATIC all-wheel drive was offered.[3]\r\n\r\nThe CLS range is positioned between the E-Class and the S-Class within the Mercedes model range,[4][5] and models tend to be less practical than the E-Class it is based on.[6] It primarily competes with other fastback sedans like the BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe, Porsche Panamera and Audi A7."
