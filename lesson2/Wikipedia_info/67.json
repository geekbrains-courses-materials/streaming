    "info": "The Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class is a compact executive roadster, produced by Mercedes-Benz. It was released in 1996 and was built at the Mercedes plant in Bremen, Germany, until the end of production in 2020.\r\n\r\nThe former name \"SLK\" was derived from sportlich (sporty), leicht (lightweight), and kurz (short).[1] With the release of the facelift R172 in 2016, the SLK-Class was renamed to SLC-Class in accordance with the revised nomenclature adopted by Mercedes. Under this scheme, roadsters use the base name \"SL\", followed by the model's placement in Mercedes-Benz hierarchy, the letter \"C\", being the roadster equivalent to the C-Class."
