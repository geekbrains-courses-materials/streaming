    "info": "The Audi TT is a 2-door production sports car made by Audi since 1998, and currently in its third generation. The first two generations were assembled by the Audi subsidiary Audi Hungaria Motor Kft. in Gy\u0151r, Hungary, using bodyshells manufactured and painted at Audi's Ingolstadt plant[1] and parts made entirely by the Hungarian factory for the third generation.[2]\r\n\r\nFor each of its three generations, the TT has been available as a 2+2 coup\u00e9 and as a two-seater roadster employing consecutive generations of the Volkswagen Group A platform, starting with the A4 (PQ34). As a result of this platform-sharing, the Audi TT has identical powertrain and suspension layouts as its related platform-mates; including a front-mounted transversely oriented engine, front-wheel drive or quattro four-wheel drive system, and fully independent front suspension using MacPherson struts."
