    "info": "The BMW 4 Series is a range of compact executive cars manufactured by BMW since 2013. The 4 Series was created when BMW spun off the 2-door models (coup\u00e9 and convertible) of the 3 Series into a separate series. The 4 Series is currently in its second generation.\r\n\r\nThe original 4 Series concept car was unveiled in January 2013 at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan.[1][2] Both generations have been produced in the coup\u00e9, convertible and 5-door liftback (marketed as \"Gran Coup\u00e9\") body styles. The engines available for the first generation were turbocharged inline-3, inline-4 and inline-6 engines fueled by petrol or diesel. For the second generation, a plug-in hybrid powertrain was introduced. As per the equivalent 3 Series generations, the 4 Series' drivetrain layout is rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive (\"xDrive\").\r\n\r\nThe BMW M4 is the high-performance version of the 4 Series. The first generation of the M4 is called the F82/F83 and uses the same turbocharged inline-six petrol engine as the F80/F81 M3."
