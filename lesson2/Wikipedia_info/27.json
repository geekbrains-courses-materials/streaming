    "info": "The BMW 5 Series is an executive car manufactured and marketed by BMW since 1972, succeeding the New Class Sedans, and currently in its seventh generation.\r\n\r\nThe 5 Series was initially available as a sedan, with a wagon/estate body style (marketed as \"Touring\") added in 1991 and a 5-door fastback configuration (marketed as \"Gran Turismo\") available from 2009 to 2017. Each successive generation carries a distinct internal E- designation.\r\n\r\nThe first generation of 5 Series was powered by naturally aspirated four-cylinder and six-cylinder petrol engines. Following generations have been powered by four-cylinder, six-cylinder, V8 and V10 engines that are either naturally aspirated or turbocharged. Since 1982, diesel engines have been included in the 5 Series range.\r\n\r\nThe 5 Series is BMW's second best-selling model after the 3 Series.[1] On 29 January 2008, the 5 millionth 5 Series was manufactured, a 530d sedan in Carbon Black Metallic.[2]\r\n\r\nBMW's three-digit model naming convention began with the first 5 Series,[3] thus the 5 Series was BMW's first model line to use \"Series\" in the name.\r\n\r\nSince the E28, all generations of 5 Series have included an \"M\" model, called the BMW M5."
