    "info": "The Hyundai Santa Fe (Korean: \ud604\ub300 \uc2fc\ud0c0\ud398) is a sport utility vehicle (SUV) produced by the South Korean manufacturer Hyundai since 2000. It is named after the city of Santa Fe, New Mexico, and was introduced for the 2001 model year as Hyundai's first SUV. The Santa Fe was a milestone in the company's restructuring program of the late 1990s because the SUV was a hit with American buyers. Between 2006 and 2012, the Santa Fe was positioned between the smaller Tucson compact crossover and the larger Veracruz.\r\n\r\nThe third-generation Santa Fe introduced in 2012 was available in two versions, which are regular (short) and extended long-wheelbase version. The short model was sold as the Santa Fe Sport in North America (three-row seating was not available) and simply Santa Fe in global markets (three-row seating was standard or optional), while the extended long-wheelbase model is called the Santa Fe in the USA, Santa Fe XL in Canada and called the Hyundai Maxcruz in South Korea.\r\n\r\nThe fourth-generation Santa Fe has been slotted between the Tucson and the Palisade, with the latter being the replacement of the long-wheelbase Santa Fe."
