    "info": "The BMW 1 Series is a range of subcompact executive cars (C-segment) manufactured by BMW since 2004. It is the successor to the BMW 3 Series Compact and is currently in its third generation. Positioned as the entry level model in BMW range of products, the first generation was produced in hatchback, coup\u00e9 and convertible body styles.\r\n\r\nSince 2014, the coup\u00e9 and convertible models have been marketed separately as the 2 Series, therefore the 1 Series range no longer includes these body styles. A four-door sedan model became available for the Chinese market in 2017, using the front-wheel drive platform that is also used the basis for the third-generation 1 Series hatchback.\r\n\r\nA high-performance BMW M version called the BMW 1 Series M Coup\u00e9 was produced for the first generation. Due to the 1 Series coup\u00e9 model being replaced by the 2 Series, the 1 Series M Coup\u00e9 was replaced by the BMW M2 in 2016.\r\n\r\nFor the first two generations, the 1 Series uses a rear-wheel drive layout, while all-wheel drive was introduced as an option since 2012. For the third generation introduced in 2019, the 1 Series switched to a front-wheel drive layout, while retaining the all-wheel drive option.[1]"
