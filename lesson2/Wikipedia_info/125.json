It was the direct successor to the European Carina E and was available as a four-door saloon, five-door liftback and estate.\r\n\r\nThe Avensis was introduced in 1997, to create a more modern name when compared with the Carina E. The \"Avensis\" name is derived from the French term avancer, meaning \"to advance\" or \"move forward\".[1] The Avensis was not sold in North America, and it is related to the Scion tC coup\u00e9. It also shared a platform with the Allion and Premio and was available at Japanese dealership network Toyota Corolla Store.\r\n\r\nA large MPV called the Avensis Verso (Ipsum in Japan and previously the Picnic in other markets) was built in Japan on a separate platform."
