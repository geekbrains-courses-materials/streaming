    "info": "The Ford Mondeo is a large family car manufactured by Ford since 1993. The first Ford model declared as a \"world car\",[citation needed] the Mondeo was intended to consolidate several Ford model lines worldwide (the European Sierra, the Telstar in Asia and Australia, and the Tempo/Mercury Topaz in North America). The Mondeo nameplate is derived from Latin word \"mundus\", meaning \"world\".[2] As of 2018, Ford has produced five versions of the Mondeo across four generations.\r\n\r\nFor its first two generations, the Mondeo was produced using the CDW27 platform, with the third-generation model shifting to the EUCD platform. The fourth-generation model uses the CD4 platform (the first car to do so).\r\n\r\nDue to declining sales and a growing trend towards crossover SUVs over saloons and estates, Ford plans to discontinue the Mondeo in Europe and Argentina in March 2022 with no direct successor."
