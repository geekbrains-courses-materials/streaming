    "info": "The BMW 2 Series is a range of subcompact executive cars (C-segment) manufactured by BMW since 2014. The 2 Series was created when BMW spun-off the 2-door models (coup\u00e9 and convertible) of the BMW 1 Series into a separate series.\r\n\r\nThe 2 Series was first launched as a 2-door coup\u00e9 and convertible, both based on a rear-wheel drive platform. A year later, the Active Tourer 5-seat compact MPV body style was added, based on the unrelated front-wheel drive platform shared with the Mini Hatch (F55/56/57). This was followed by a 7-seat version called the Gran Tourer.[1] In 2019, the Gran Coup\u00e9 fastback sedan joined the 2 Series family as a front-wheel drive vehicle based on the 1 Series hatchback and has been marketed as a 4-door coupe. In 2021, BMW released the second-generation 2-door coup\u00e9, rear-wheel drive 2 Series in July 2021.[2]\r\n\r\nThe BMW M2 is the high-performance version of the 2 Series 2-door coup\u00e9. The first generation of the M2 is the F87 coup\u00e9 and is powered by turbocharged straight-six engines."
