    "info": "The BMW 8 Series is a range of grand tourer coupes and convertibles produced by BMW.\r\n\r\nThe 8 Series was introduced in 1990 under the E31 model code and was only available as a two-door coup\u00e9.[1] It is powered by a range of naturally aspirated V8 and V12 petrol engines.[2] The E31 started production just as E24 6 Series production ended, however it is not considered a direct successor.[3] The E31 was discontinued in 1999 due to poor sales.[4]\r\n\r\nThe model range was later reintroduced in 2018 with the second generation, G15 8 Series.[5] It launched in coup\u00e9 (G15), convertible (G14), and four-door Gran Coup\u00e9 (G16) body styles, as the successor to the F06/F12/F13 6 Series lineup.[6] The G15 8 Series introduces an inline-six diesel engine,[7][8] and a high-performance BMW M8 trim later joined the lineup as well as the luxury inspired Alpina B8.[9]"
