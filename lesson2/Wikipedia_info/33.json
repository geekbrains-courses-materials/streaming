    "info": "The BMW X3 is a compact luxury crossover SUV manufactured by German automaker BMW since 2003, based on the BMW 5 Series platform. Now in its third generation, BMW markets the crossover as a Sports Activity Vehicle, the company's proprietary descriptor for its X-line of vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe first-generation X3 was designed by BMW in conjunction with Magna Steyr of Graz, Austria\u2014who also manufactured all X3s under contract to BMW. BMW manufactured the second-generation X3 at their Spartanburg plant in South Carolina, United States. The third-generation of the BMW X3 is manufactured at BMW South Africa's Rosslyn plant, a facility that underwent a major upgrade to prepare for the X3 production, replacing the long-running 3 Series production in the plant. About 76,000 units will be manufactured there annually.[1]\r\n\r\nIt was considered as the first mid-size, premium SUV on the market.[2] Only since 2008, X3 started competing with the Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class (renamed GLC-Class since 2016), and numerous other SUVs in this segment. Currently, it slots below the larger X5 and X6, and above the smaller X1 and the X2.\r\n\r\nAn all-electric variant is sold as the BMW iX3."
