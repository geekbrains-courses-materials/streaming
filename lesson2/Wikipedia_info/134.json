    "info": "The Urban Cruiser is a version of the second generation Ist that was sold in Europe. It was first introduced in 2008. It is slotted below the RAV4 to compete against small crossover SUVs like the Nissan Qashqai and Kia Soul, while also attracting buyers of mainstream family hatchbacks. Designed by Toyota ED\u00b2,[11] it debuted at the March 2008 Geneva Motor Show and went on sale shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nThe Urban Cruiser did not have sales success in Europe after 2011 due to the ongoing strength of the Japanese yen, and production was discontinued in 2014. It was replaced by the Yaris Cross in 2021.[1][2]\r\n\r\nThe \"Urban Cruiser\" nameplate is reused in August 2020 for the rebadged Suzuki Vitara Brezza.\r\n\r\nMechanicals and emissions\r\nThe Urban Cruiser is powered by a 1,329 cc petrol engine that produces 99 PS (73 kW) and 132 N\u22c5m (97 lb\u22c5ft), or a 90 PS (66 kW), 205 N\u22c5m (151 lb\u22c5ft) 1,364 cc turbo diesel. Front-wheel drive is standard, but the diesel model is also offered with an all-wheel drive option. Both come with a 6-speed manual transmission. There is no automatic option.\r\n\r\nSafety\r\nDespite being equipped with seven airbags, anti-lock brakes and traction control, the car received a relatively poor Euro NCAP safety rating of 3/5 stars.[12]"
